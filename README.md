# unit-4-game

So, with this game the player picks a hero from the starting 4 heroes.
The 3 remaining heroes are then moved to the "enemies available to attack" area.
At that point, the hero must choose an enemy to attack. Once the player chooses an enemy to attack, that enemy moves to the "defender" area and then the attack button becomes available.
With each attack, the hero does his attack damage to the defender, and the enemy does their counter attack damage to the hero. The twist is that with each sucessful attack, the hero's attack power gets stronger by a factor of his starting damage while the counter attack damage stays the same.
Once a defender is below or at 0 hp, they go away and the player must choose a new enemy to attack.
Win by defeating all 3 enemies. Or lose, your choice.
